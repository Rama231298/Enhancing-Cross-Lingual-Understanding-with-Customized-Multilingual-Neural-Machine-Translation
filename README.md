Enhancing Cross-Lingual Capabilities

This project aims to enhance cross-lingual capabilities in computational models, focusing on improving how these models handle multiple languages. The main component of the project is a Jupyter notebook that details experiments, methodologies, and insights derived from the latest advancements in machine learning and natural language processing.

Getting Started

Prerequisites

Before you can run the notebook, you need to ensure your system has the following software installed:

Python 3.8 or higher
Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab
Installation

To get started with this project, clone the repository to your local machine:

Clone the repository:
git clone https://github.com/Rama231298/Enhancing-Cross-Lingual-Understanding-with-Customized-Multilingual-Neural-Machine-Translation.git
Change to the project directory: cd enhancing-cross-lingual

This setup will allow you to run the Jupyter notebook and engage with the project's experiments and methodologies directly.
